# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Redux] (https://redux.js.org)
- [Zoom](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api)
- [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/docs/)
